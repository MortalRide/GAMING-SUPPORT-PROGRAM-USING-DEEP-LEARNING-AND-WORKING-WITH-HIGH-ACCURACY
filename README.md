The project was made as an bachelor's thesis. 
It was developed with Berkay Kaan TAŞKIN. 
The project's advisor was Professor Ahmet Emir DİRİK.

Today, with the development of computer and artificial intelligence technologies, most of the monotonous and repetitive tasks are automated. One of the most interesting sub-fields of these artificial intelligence technologies is computer vision and object recognition technologies. Examples of application areas of these technologies are lightless factories, autonomous vehicles and face recognition applications. The main reasons why these technologies have become so widespread in recent years can be shown as the development of graphics processing units (GPU), processor technologies and the fact that studies on the human nervous system allow the development of artificial intelligence technologies. This developing technology is capable of becoming widespread in certain areas within military applications. For example, it is very difficult for a soldier guarding the border to detect whether people outside the border are friends or foes, both day and night, and take action accordingly. Instead, with an automated turret system, this soldier's task can be fully accomplished. In this project we have done, we aimed to show that these and similar functions can be performed automatically. For this purpose, a program has been created by using a computer game as a controllable simulation environment, to detect targets in this environment and to eliminate these targets by giving appropriate commands.
